   * is a legitimate thing a user may keep). Instead, existence differences are propagated like file
   * creates/deletes, tracked in the StateDB so absence means a real deletion, not "never existed":
   *
   *   - local-only & untracked   → the user created it here   → MKCOL on the remote (incl. EMPTY dirs)
   *   - remote-only & untracked  → created on another device   → mkdir locally
   *   - tracked, now local-absent → the user deleted it here   → DELETE the remote collection
   *   - tracked, now remote-absent→ deleted on another device  → trash it locally
   *   - present both sides        → record/keep tracking
   *   - absent both sides         → drop stale tracking
   *
   * Runs only on a COMPLETE listing (full scan); absence from a partial token diff is not a deletion.
   * Safety mirrors file deletion: a `massDeleteLimit` circuit breaker guards a suspiciously large
   * destructive batch (partial/failed listing); a recursive collection DELETE is preceded by an
   * `isRemoteDirEmpty` probe (children are deleted first by ordering + the earlier file phase) and
   * optionally wrapped in a lock when the user enabled `fileLockingEnabled`; every failure is left
   * for the next sync (self-healing).
