// Pure helpers for the user-managed "Excluded folders" sync filter.
//
// A file is excluded when its vault-relative path matches a registered entry at a
// folder boundary (prefix match): entry itself, or anything under "entry/". This is
// intentionally NOT a substring match, so "Attachments" never captures "Attachments-old".
// No glob/wildcard support — folder-prefix only — to keep the setting fool-proof.

/**
 * Machine-managed vault-root folders that are ALWAYS excluded from sync, independent of the user's
 * excludedFolders list. Matched with the same folder-boundary rule as user entries
 * (`isUnderExcludedFolder`), so only these exact folders and their descendants are excluded — never
 * same-prefix siblings (`.github`, `.trashcan`) or same-prefix files (`.gitignore`).
 *
 *  - `.git`   — a machine-managed repository; piecewise file sync corrupts it (discussion #6).
 *  - `.trash` — Obsidian's device-local trash; syncing it clutters every device and churns against
 *               the plugin's own trashFile-based deletion (remote delete → local .trash → re-upload).
 *
 * This is a TARGETED list, not a blanket "all dotfolders" rule: other root dot content (`.archive/`,
 * `.env`) must keep syncing (Task 7 / collectDotPaths).
