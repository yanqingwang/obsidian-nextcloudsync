"Latest modified" uses file mtime — beware clock skew between devices.',
  conflictStrategy:

Conflict markers keeps both versions in the file (frontmatter, which cannot hold markers, falls back to Latest modified). Biggest size / Latest modified / Local wins / Remote wins resolve each conflicting part deterministically. A deterministic body/frontmatter strategy never conflicts, so this is inert for it.',
